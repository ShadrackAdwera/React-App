# Side Effects

Tasks happening outside of the normal component evaluation and render cycle especially since they may block / delay rendering.

Side Effects can also happen when triggering action B in response to action A. For instance adding a class around an input field in response to an onBlur event. A side effect on the user interacting with the form.
